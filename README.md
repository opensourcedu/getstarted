# GET INVOLVED 

# Introduction
This open source initiative creates a free learning platform for learners and independent coaches. Coaches passionate about coaching for as low as a pack of coffee and four chocolate bars. Learners who can take advantage of the opportunity provided to master their desired technology at the cost of commitment and willingness to contribute back to open source. As an open source initiative, everyone is welcome to support, maintain and improve the project through selfless-donations or commitment to the project. 

The aim and purpose of this initiative are to provide a mentorship path for folks willing to give back to the community, and projects.

## Patrons 

Patrons are individuals who are willing to be part of the initiative of providing a free mentorship path for their favourite open source project. 

As a patron, you are not just helping someone learn but also building the community you love by:
1) empowering folks who canâ€™t afford paid courses on the internet
2) engaging with a broader and diverse community 
3) providing mentorship to individuals excited to contribute back to open source. 
4) improving open source software by investing in potential collaborators/contributors to your favourite open source project.
 
As a patron you can make multiple donations of a minimum amount of $200 or more. A  patron can also be a volunteer Independent Coach that decides to re-donate their due bonuses for Independent coaches and still offers $50 to helps us maintain the infrastructures. 

The paid $200 help us purchase a cup of coffee, and four chocolate bars of $150 for Independent Coaches and the leftover $50 is used to maintain our services and infrastructures.  

## Independent Coaches
Independent coaches are individuals passionate about training folks on their favourite open source (JavaScript/Python) library, framework or technology.
Independent coaches engage directly with Learners over weekend webinars for a duration of 16weeks (cohort): 
- 12 weeks of coaching and 
- 4 weeks guiding your prodigies make actual commits

Independent coaches are preferably contributors/collaborators to the technology, framework, or library they coach. Independent coaches are to understand the level of commitment and patience required to teach and coach an individual to almost perfection. 
An independent coach can be one library, framework, and technology proficient, or can be a multi-stack proficient. An Independent Coach can either decide to design his/her documents for coaching on Stacks docs for learners or use existing materials on the internet. Independent coaches are to provide challenges to keep learners engage during the week, while learners get coached accurately over the weekend; this learning framework can be considered to be weekend-meet-ups.
